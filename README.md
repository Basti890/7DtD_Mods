# 7DtD_Mods

Just download the both mods and paste them in: %APPDATA%/7DaysToDie/Mods (create the Mods folder if iot does not exist).

You are free to suggest changes and bugfixes.

The ZT-Beautifull but Immersive is just slightly changed from me and i have no impact on the strage red / green glow of the added lights. 
My changes to this Moddlet are: 
* Make Oven, Stove, Microwave and Oventop usable as campfire
* Make Kitchen sinks usable as Watersource
